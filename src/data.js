    "Hi, I've been through a lot, I mean... in general work experience,\
but my final stop and arguably something I have fallen in love with, is programming and creating awesome web apps and systems. I\
was born in Sudan, grew up a refugee in Uganda and living as a refugee in Egypt. Being a refugee comes with lots of difficulties\
and barriers, that's why you will see sudden changes in careers and a gap in my profile. The result is a cocktail of diverse \
experiences that perfectly work together when needed. I'm about to take you on a roller coaster of hard earned achievements, ready?\
